Requirements for Msg Send and Msg Fetch look alikes

msgSend:
	needs send(body) -- body needs userId and messages and whatever else you wish to collect
	An id attribute that is set as "sender"

msgFetch:
	needs observe(this,this.append) -- this is the object and this.append is the callback function
									   that will append an array of userid and message pairs and 
									   prints it.
	An id attribute that is set as "receiver"
