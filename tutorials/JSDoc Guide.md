## How JSDoc Works

Here I'll just tell you how to use this tool.  
In the source folder (/src), put your .js file with comments in JS Documentation format  
If you need any specific description or if you don't know how to comment in the format, please refer to the Jira example.  

If you need to do a sequence diagram, please refer to the jsdoc mermaid documentation.  

@see   
@todo  
@example <==Important==>  

Then we have the core ones,  
@typedef  
@property {Type} id def  
@param  
@return
