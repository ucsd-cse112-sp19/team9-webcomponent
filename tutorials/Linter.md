# Lint

Linter is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.  
At the moment, we are just using ESlint and Stylelint.  

## ESLint

You can run ESLint on any of you JavaScript file in the web_component folder with the command  
>npm run lint

This is because there is a reference in the package.json file.  

Let's take a look at the eslint.js file.

We are running the recommended option of ESLint. In this file you can modify the rules. Please see the ESLint documentation.
The recommended option uses Airbnb style.
You can disable a rule at any time by commenting /* eslint-disable <=insert you rule here=> */ on top of your line.
You can turn off a rule in the eslint.js file. Just add "<=insert the rule name=>":"off" 

## StyleLint

Style lint is used for CSS. In the pipeline, we only run it on the files in the web_component folder but feel free to try it out on your files.  
the basic structure is already implemented and uses the recommended style.
